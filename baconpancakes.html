    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bacon Pancakes are pancakes with bacon in them</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li id = "flour">Flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Baking power</li>
        <li>Buttermilk</li>
        <li>Bacon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 200 degrees. In a bowl,
            whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder,
            baking soda, and salt. In another bowl,
            whisk together buttermilk, melted butter,
            and egg. Whisk flour mixture into buttermilk
            mixture just until moistened, with small to medium lumps remaining.
        </li>
        <li>In a large cast-iron or nonstick skillet or on a griddle,
            cook bacon over medium-high until fat is rendered and bacon 
            is browned on one side, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and cook until
            golden and crisp on underside, 1 to 3 minutes. Drain bacon
            on paper towels; pour off all but 1 teaspoon fat from skillet
            (reserve for another use).
        </li>    
        <li>Heat skillet over medium. Pour 1/4-cupfuls batter into skillet
            and top each with a bacon slice. Cook until some bubbles appear
            on top of pancakes and a few have burst, about 2 minutes.
            with a spatula, carefully flip pancakes and cook until
            browned on underside, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a platter,
            bacon side up, and loosely tent with foil. Keep pancakes warm 
            in oven and repeat with remaining batter, adding more bacon fat
            if needed. Serve with pure maple syrup, if desired.
        </li>
    </ol>
